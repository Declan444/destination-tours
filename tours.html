                    <hr>
                    <p>A family of wealth and influence, the Rochfort family came to Ireland in the 13th Century, and Robert Rochfort would
                    later become the 1st Earl of Belvedere and a Member of Parliament for Westmeath.
                    Robert was known to be selfish and unkind, but under pressure from her family to marry well, Mary Molesworth accepted
                    his proposal, and they married in 1736 when Mary was just 16 years old. Mary was a talented woman, known and admired in
                    the theatrical circles of Dublin, but her life was to be transformed forever.
                    
                    The couple settled at the Rochfort’s ancestral home, Gaulstown House, with Robert’s younger brother Arthur living nearby
                    at Belfield House with his wife Sarah. Let Des tell you the rest of the story.</p>
